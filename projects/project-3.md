summary: A JavaFX application I developed for my course.

<img class="ui image" src="../images/oop2.gif">

In a number of weeks I developed an application with a GUI. I used JavaFX for the scene, the Model-View-Controller (MVC) Design Pattern for the code layout and a Data Access Object (DAO) Design Pattern for loading and saving data.

This application should be able to add a Master object and adjust it's data. Once a master is selected the child component should be linked with its master.
There is a one-to-many relation between the master and child component.
